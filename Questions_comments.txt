

After reading the README.md I had many questions that I would normaly ask before starting coding.


1) I was not sure the purpose of the comment "Clone or download the repository, do not fork it."
2) the data provided in the senior-code-challenge\src\main\resources\static\employee_database.json did not match the README

For following questions, I assumed :

Specificaly for task 1
1) the two properties: employee and numberOfReports did not have specific types so I assumed that
	employee was of type employee
	numberOfReports was of type int with a valid range of 0 to infinity
2) The new REST endpoint was not specified so I assume it would be localhost:8080/reportingstructure/{id}
3) The error case for an invalid employeeId is the same as for a READ of an invalid employee id.

Specificaly for task 2
1) the fields: employee, salary, and effectiveDate
	employee is of type employee
	salary is of type string, that is checked to be >= 0, it could be coded as an int.
	effectiveDate is of type String, it could have been of type Date.
	
2) The new REST endpoint was not specified so I assume it would be localhost:8080/compensation/{id} and the data package
is "employeeId":"<UUID>","salary":"<someString","effectiveDate":"<someString>"


In summary, I'm not sure if what I did is what you wanted but it does "work".
I tried to follow the existing code patterns and did not add as may comments that I would for production code.
